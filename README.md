# Sage Lessons at Lancaster University, February 2020

Notebooks and material for a Sage lesson at Lanacaster university February 2020 built on number theory examples.

The pace might seem to be fast but this is mainly because we often just touch briefly
on the various topics. The intention is that the student should become aware of the different 
structures and commands, so don't worry if it seems a bit too much.  

An overview of the different topics covered in the lessons are as follows; 

- Lesson 1: Introduction to SagMeMath 
    - How to run and use SageMath effectively
    - Elements of programming in Python and SageMath
    - Functions
- Lesson 2: The Riemann Zeta function 
    - Loops, control structures and list comprehnsions etc.
    - First plot
- Lesson 3: Euler - Mc Laurin summation formula and Bernoulli numbers
    - Symbolic epressions in SageMath
- Lesson 4
    - Lambda functions
    - Recursive functions
    - Symbolic and numerical integrals
- Lesson 5: Euler - Mc  Laurin evaluation of the zeta function 
    - introduction to "object oriented programming", objects and classes in Python
- Lesson 6: Visualization of data
    - Plotting in SageMath
    - Exporting plots.
- Lesson 7: Performance
    - Basic profiling and timing of programs
- Lesson 8: The modular group
    - Finite and infinite groups in SageMath
    - Permutations
- Lesson 9: Finite matrix groups
    - Finite matrix groups and group characters

**Note**: These lessons are completely new and currently under development in the sense that we don't know how long time they will take or if we miss something important. Please provide feedback to the author: Fredrik Stromberg (mailto://fredrik314@gmail.com)
