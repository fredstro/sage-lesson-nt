    "# Lesson 2 - The Riemann zeta function\n",

    "## Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "- **Python**\n",
    "  - Iteration with `for` loops\n",
    "  - Conditional programming with `if`, `elif`, and `else`\n",
    "  - The `range` function\n",
    "  - List comprehensions\n",
    "- **SageMath**\n",
    "  - Plotting in 1D\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ is defined for $s$ with real part greater than $1$ by \n",
    "$$ \\zeta(s) = 1 + 2^{-s} + 3^{-s} \\cdots = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^{-s} $$\n",
    "It is known that \n",
    "1. $\\zeta(s)$ can be extended to an analytic (holomorphic) function in the entire complex plane except for a simple pole with residue $1$ at $s=1$.\n",
    "2. $\\zeta(s)$ satisfies a functional equation when reflecting in the line $\\Re(s)=1/2$ of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\zeta(s) = 2^s \\pi^{s-1} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}) \\Gamma(1-s) \\zeta(1-s) $$\n",
    "3. $\\zeta(-2n) = 0$ for each positive integer $n$ (these are called trivial zeros)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main unsolved problems in number theory today is the **Riemann Hypothesis** which states that all non-trivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ lie on the line $\\Re(s) = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence for this conjecture is mainly experimental and has been verified up to a very large height. \n",
